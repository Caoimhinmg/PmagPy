Why:

Make_magic.py is a Python program for putting together a contribution for the MagIC database.  Make_magic.py is specifically designed for making a contribution without measurement data; if you ARE including measurement data, we recommend that you use QuickMagIC instead.  Make_magic allows you to add data at the location, site, sample, and specimen levels.  You can also add results and ages.  Make_magic uses an Excel-like grid interface for entering and editing data.  Useful features include: pop-up menus with controlled vocabularies, multi-cell pasting from external spreadsheets, and built-in validations for MagIC database requirements.
