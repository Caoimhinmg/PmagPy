	-fsi: specimen input er_sites format file, default is "er_sites.txt"
	-fla: specify a file with paleolatitudes for calculating VADMs, default is not to calculate VADMS
               format is:  site_name paleolatitude (space delimited file)
	-fa AGES: specify er_ages format file with age information
	-crd [s,g,t,b]:   specify coordinate system
	    (s, specimen, g geographic, t, tilt corrected, b, geographic and tilt corrected)
	    Default is to assume geographic
	    NB: only the tilt corrected data will appear on the results table, if both g and t are selected.
        -cor [AC:CR:NL]: colon delimited list of required data adjustments for all specimens 
            included in intensity calculations (anisotropy, cooling rate, non-linear TRM)
            unless specified, corrections will not be applied
        -pri [TRM:ARM] colon delimited list of priorities for anisotropy correction (-cor must also be set to include AC). default is TRM, then ARM 
	-age MIN MAX UNITS:   specify age boundaries and units
	-exc:  use exiting selection criteria (in pmag_criteria.txt file), default is default criteria
	-C: no acceptance criteria
	-aD:  average directions per sample, default is NOT
	-aI:  average multiple specimen intensities per sample, default is by site 
	-aC:  average all components together, default is NOT
	-pol:  calculate polarity averages
	-sam:  save sample level vgps and v[a]dms, default is by site
	-xSi:  skip the site level intensity calculation

        converts CIT and .sam  format files to magic_measurements format files

    SYNTAX
        CIT_magic.py [command line options]

    OPTIONS
        -h: prints the help message and quits.
        -usr USER:   identify user, default is ""
        -f FILE: specify .sam format input file, required
        -fsi SITEFILE : specify file with site names and locations [tab delimited magic file]
        -F FILE: specify output  measurements file, default is magic_measurements.txt
        -Fsp FILE: specify output er_specimens.txt file, default is er_specimens.txt
        -Fsi FILE: specify output er_sites.txt file, default is er_sites.txt
        -Fsa FILE: specify output er_samples.txt file, default is er_samples.txt  # LORI
        -n [gm,kg,cc,m3]: specify normalization
        -spc NUM : specify number of characters to designate a  specimen, default = 0
        -ncn NCON: specify naming convention
        -loc LOCNAME : specify location/study name, must have either LOCNAME or SITEFILE or be a synthetic
        -mcd [FS-FD:SO-MAG,.....] colon delimited list for method codes applied to all specimens in .sam file
        -dc B PHI THETA: dc lab field (in micro tesla) and phi,theta, default is none
              NB: use PHI, THETA = -1 -1 to signal that it changes, i.e. in anisotropy experiment
        -ac B : peak AF field (in mT) for ARM acquisition, default is none

    INPUT
        Best to put separate experiments (all AF, thermal, thellier, trm aquisition, Shaw, etc.) 

    NOTES:
         Sample naming convention:
            [1] XXXXY: where XXXX is an arbitrary length site designation and Y
                is the single character sample designation.  e.g., TG001a is the
                first sample from site TG001.    [default]
            [2] XXXX-YY: YY sample from site XXXX (XXX, YY of arbitary length)
            [3] XXXX.YY: YY sample from site XXXX (XXX, YY of arbitary length) [default]
            [4-Z] XXXXYYY:  YYY is sample designation with Z characters from site XXX
            [5] all others you will have to either customize your
                self or e-mail ltauxe@ucsd.edu for help.
