find_EI problems:
        $ find_EI.py -f find_EI_example.dat
        works
        python Bootstrap.py -r find_EI.py
        works
        so.... no problem?

magic_select.py
        fixed


lnp_magic.py
        added missing parentheses 
        fixed, but you still have a problem:
        I just realized a problem is that I can only test the installed pythonpath version of Pmag.py.  This may have been a mistake.  it might have been better to test it locally.  oh fuck.
