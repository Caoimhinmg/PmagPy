find_EI problems:
        $ find_EI.py -f find_EI_example.dat
        works
        python Bootstrap.py -r find_EI.py
        works
        so.... no problem?

magic_select.py
        fixed


curie.py
        fixed
        added sys.exit()

lnp_magic.py
        added missing parentheses 
        fixed, but you still have a problem:
        I just realized a problem is that I can only test the installed pythonpath version of Pmag.py.  This may have been a mistake.  it might have been better to test it locally.  oh fuck.  

something_with_magic_keys.py
        fixed test

igrf.py

        subtly changed output
        someone else must debug

tdt_magic.py
        can no longer test because a gui window pops up and breaks it

HUJI_magic.py

        certain variables are only set given a particular flag, but then referenced either way.  is this a problem for actual use, or just testing?

specimen_results_magic.py
        
        new output column was added

IODP_csv_magic
        
        new output column was added



package-a-fy pmagpy so you can call tests
             angle.py test works!

             consider shortening log output
             also, consider changing framework for how tests are run, so that errors are actually raised


travis progress:

       'python Rename_me.py' -- works
       'python raise_exception.py' will cause the build to fail, however if that code is nested in a bash script, it will NOT cause the build to fail.

consider re-tooling how this type of output is processed (order matters right now, but it shouldn't)  urgh.
